3,Brandon Aiyuk,11,,We love brock and aiyuk. They are the future  go get that ring fellas,ayuik pls give purdy another year yall both are strong together now yall have a full camp together,"I doubt any other bloggers will post about this, they keep pushing this agenda he not coming back. Aiyuk is coming back!!!",That catch from Brandon Aiyuk was insane. Reminds me of last yearâ€™s NFL Divisional Round between the Niners and Cowboys when George Kittle made an incredible catch from Brock Purdy.,

1,Aaron Banks,65,,"1st Team All-American at ND! This guy is a mauler and heady player. No doubt he will start and learn from our veterans!! Not to mention that he's from Alameda. 49ers stacking the trenches, love i",I'm pumped that the 49ers picked up Dancing Bear Aaron Banks...Let's gooooooo!!!!,"Any ND offensive lineman, is a great football player..... change my mind",,

1,Robert Beal Jr.,51,,Outstanding player. Will miss watching him suit up for the Dawgs. I hope he has a great career for San Francisco,Iâ€™ll trust the niners on this one hopefully they can make up for getting rid of defo for kinlaw ðŸ˜‚,Nolan Smith was hyped. Robert Beal jr is better from looking at the production,Big Dawg Beal Jr. fits perfectly with this scary ass defense. Go Niners!!!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥,
3,Ronnie Bell,10,,Looks like we're in for another year of late round rookies going off. Congrats to Ronnie Bell for getting his first NFL TD.,,,,
1,Nick Bosa,97,,Nick Bosa is one of the leagueâ€™s best run defenders,"I yield to no one in my admiration for Mr. Bosa, but sometimes he really flings his targeted QB down.","Nick Bosa didnâ€™t have the sack numbers he usually has, but he is still a monster. He wrecks the game-plan.",Nick Bosa go get them next year,Nick bosa had a great season
5,Jake Brendel,64,,Jake brendel got me rollingðŸ˜‚,,,,
2,Earnest Brown IV,,,Ernest William Brown Drafts Him ?,,,,
3,Ji'Ayir Brown,27,,"Great interview Sherman!!! Ji' Ayir Brown is going to be something special, and I can't wait to see this brother out on the field again. 49ers4life baby!!!!","Love Ji'Ayir BrownðŸ‘Š this guy stays healthy, he'll have a HOF career.","Ji'Ayir Brown is legit, the 1st game he came in to replace Talanoa Hufanga I was telling people he was better and they were calling me crazy, but he covers better, plays with more 'suddenness' as they say, you could see it right away, he makes the 49ers better IMO. Keep sticking up for our boy Purdy too on the national stage, he is the next montana, young and you know it..throw them analytics in their face until they can no longer deny it..I think the lack of respect he was talking about that fueled him which they are not giving to purdy makes him mad. Sherm is like what else this boy got to do? He has being the best QB in the NFL, putting up historical QB numbers on tape in the league for well over a year and they still won't give it to him? Like what is wrong with these fools? You can tell it makes sherm angry since it speaks to his own story.","Man, this kid is very smart. I hope he stays a 49er for life. He is just AMAZING! Ji'Ayir Brown has a great start to his career!",
4,Austin Bryant,40,,Loved Austin Bryant in detroit dude bout to ball out in San fran,To the people watching this video. If Austin Bryant gets drafted what team do you think heâ€™ll get drafted by? Bills Dolphins/Phins/Fins Patriots/Pats Jets Ravens Bengals Browns Steelers Texans Colts Jaguars/Jags Titans Broncos Chiefs Chargers/Bolts Raiders Cowboys/Boys Giants Eagles Redskins/Skins Bears Lions Packers/Pack Vikings/Vikes Falcons Panthers Saints Buccaneers/Bucs Cardinals/Cards Rams 49ers/Niners Seahawks/Hawks,,,
2,Spencer Burford,74,,"Chris Jones is now a free agent! If you canâ€™t beat him, convince him to join your team!ðŸ˜‚ Spencer Burford isnâ€™t ready to play yet. He still makes a few boneheaded plays like this every game. Thatâ€™s why he was benched.",,,,
2,Oren Burks,48,,"Larry Krueger just showed all you video reporters how to keep a guy engaged -- his 49er linebacker gave interesting answers for almost 3 minutes. Oren Burks looked like a gamer today. And Burks is gonna want to keep this video record of his big moment against the Cowboys, the day when the Niner reporters came up to his locker to talk to him about it. Krueger gave Burks lots of angles to speak at length about Burks' role in this epic victory in the long rivalry between the Boys and the Niners.",,,,
1,Chris Conley,84,,Nobody: Chris Conley: we need some juice,Its crazy I went to highschool with Chris Conley. We had PE together.,,,
1,Sam Darnold,14,,ook mark this.. Sam Darnold will earn the start for the 9ers and take them to the Super Bowl! He will also be known as Sammy Dimes.,and our 2023 Super Bowl Champ will be Sam Darnold with the Niners. I like Purdy and all but he doesn't have these tools.,Welcome to Niners Nation Sam Darnold!,,
2,Jon Feliciano,55,,"If jon feliciano didn't get hurt, we would've won. jon is 100x better than spencer i dont know who to block buford",Jon feliciono and Trent Williams side by side.. Not fair for the defense.... CM gonna be running that side all day,,,
4,Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles,45,,This is great!!! George Odum and Demetrius Fannigan-Fowles are hella funny ðŸ˜‚! I was at the Jacksonville game last year and Carolina this year and it was a sea of red in the stadiums all red everywhere Bang Bang Niner Gang,"Weâ€™re definitely drafting lb at some point. Letâ€™s go Cam Jones baby! Also, Dorian Williams is an absolute stud. Diabate is a rally interesting late round developmental type. Shaka Heyward is huge guy that moves really well and has flashed some outstanding coverage instincts. But one of my absolute favorite players in this draft after extensive tape study of most of the class is Cam Jones. An absolute dog that plays football like a man possessed and has rare leadership qualities: only 3 time captain in the history of Indiana football.",,,
